**This page focuses on the "small things that do big differences". If you are looking for a straightforward feature list, take a [detour here](Feature-list)**.

# For admins
* **GUI Driven**: Due to the fact that most people find in-game GUIs to be flexible, interactive and simple, the plugin breaks down many of the complicated parts into simple GUI menus which anyone, even with zero experience, could easily deal with.
* **Intelligible error messages**: In any process which is prone to failing, such as loading arenas or dealing with Minecraft protocol, the plugin turns scary and messy error messages into simpler, straightforward messages which can be easily fixed.
* **Customization**: The plugin gives a lot of space for user-own customization and configuration, and through JSON files, it can even allow users to add their own features to SpleefX with zero coding experience! With the extreme flexibility provided by the plugin, you can even turn it into a duels minigame!
* **Limitless possibilities**: Through extensions, arena types, and the powerful and extendable game engine, you can see SpleefX as a fit for a whole server system, rather than a simple spleef plugin.
 
# For players
* **Game statistics**: The plugin tracks many game-related statistics, such as the games played, blocks mined and wins. Let your players show off!
* **Interactivity**: The plugin allows players to interact with the plugin through GUIs and commands
* **Feature rich**: The plugin aims to provide a great fun environment with extensive possibilities to ensure your players never get bored of challenges!

# Behind-the-scenes
* **Optimization**: The code written has been heavily optimized and reviewed by many accomplished developers, and is carefully written to perform to the maximum extent.
* **No reflection!** While the plugin interacts a lot with NMS (minecraft protocol) to achieve things such as titles, clickable messages and customized explosions, none of it uses the slow reflection, yet it allows cross-version compatibility
* **Cache**: Each data storage is designed to have an appropriate, easily-accessible and a powerful caching system, in order to allow maximum performance regardless of the database type.
* **API**: The plugin provides a very flexible yet powerful API for developers to add their own features to SpleefX, such as custom extensions, arenas with their own features, and even custom commands with no hassle.
* **Fail-safe code**: The plugin efficiently handles any failing code by applying fall-backs or delivering intelligible error messages.

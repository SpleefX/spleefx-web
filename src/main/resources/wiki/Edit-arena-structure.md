This page is a short explanation of how to edit the building of an arena after creating it.

Normally, once an arena is created, the schematic is saved and cannot be modified. However, it is now possible to do that easily through a simple command.

 1. Do your desired changes to the arena
 2. Select the newly modified arena building using **WorldEdit's wand**
 3. **\[MUST]** Run `//copy` or `//cut`
 4. Run the following command:
 > /<mode> editbuilding <arena>
 5. Done!
